 * Thrust is a parallel algorithms library which resembles the C++ Standard 
 * Template Library (STL). Thrust's high-level interface greatly enhances 
 * programmer productivity while enabling performance portability between GPUs
 * and multicore CPUs. Interoperability with established technologies (such as 
 * CUDA, TBB, and OpenMP) facilitates integration with existing software. 
 * Develop high-performance applications rapidly with Thrust!
